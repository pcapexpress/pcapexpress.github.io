## PCAP EXPRESS SERIES: Wireshark Investigations
Here is a robust collection of quick forensic investigations using Wireshark and series of pcap files containing real live infections.
Lets take a look at some common techniques to observe malicious traffic and scripts in action.
**All of the samples are kindly provided by malware.....**

### [PCAP EXPRESS SERIES: Exercise 01 Fake Website ](./PCAP-EXPRESS.01.md)
*Some interesting malicious activity.*

##TECH-BUREAU SERIES: Security Operations Center in a Box
Establishing a rudimentary SOC framework, using virtualization, seting up a basic network infrastructure
with lightweight Alpine Linux servers and pluging them in to a Wazuh agent.
Creating several scenarios of attack and defence, showcasing and documenting both sides.

*Project 5527 is on the brink of an atack campaighn in which a ... encrypted schematic file is coveted by ....*

### [TECH-BUREAU SERIES: Phase 02 CVE exploits and file fragmentation. ](./TECH-BUREAU.02.md)
*With the systems hardened against such unsophisticated attacks, the advesaries pivot and try to gain a reverse shell and gain more insight on project 5527. This time the exfiltration will be stelthy, will the security outfit be able to detect protocol tunneling?*

### [TECH-BUREAU SERIES: Phase 03 The Trojan and the Workhorse ](./TECH-BUREAU.03.md)
*In the final phase with the network reinforced and new rulles created it seams that nothing can harm the Bureau from the outside. What if the threat to come from the inside instead? A seamingly legitimate e-mail, a malicious link, a perfectly ordinary piece of software.*
