PCAPEXPRESS Wireshark Series

Exercise 01: Download from fake software site
Briefing:
We are a SOC analyst, we are contacted due to a coworker downloading a suspicious file after searching for Google Authenticator. 
We confirm that an infection has occurred, we are supplied a pcap file and tasked to writing an incident report focusing on some key questions written below. In the mean time the IT department will handle wiping the affected machine. 
LAN SEGMENT DETAILS FROM THE PCAP
    • LAN segment range:  10.1.17[.]0/24   (10.1.17[.]0 through 10.1.17[.]255)
    • Domain:  bluemoontuesday[.]com
    • Active Directory (AD) domain controller:  10.1.17[.]2 - WIN-GSH54QLW48D
    • AD environment name:  BLUEMOONTUESDAY
    • LAN segment gateway:  10.1.17[.]1
    • LAN segment broadcast address:  10.1.17[.]255

TASK:
For this exercise, answer the following questions for your incident report:
    • What is the IP address of the infected Windows client?
    • What is the mac address of the infected Windows client?
    • What is the host name of the infected Windows client?
    • What is the user account name from the infected Windows client?
    • What is the likely domain name for the fake Google Authenticator page?
    • What are the IP addresses used for C2 servers for this infection?
Tools:

Wireshark – pcap inspection
VirusTotal – checking for malicious IPs and Files
CyberChef – decoding malicious traffic
md5sum – calculating file hashes


00: Prologue

This is my first exercise in a series of working with actual real world malicious network traffic. The pcap file is taken from malware-traffic-analysis.net. The goal is to showcase my thinking in a simple to follow investigation complemented by images. The outcome of the investigation will be checked with the answers provided. There will be mistakes and flaws. I’m trying to show what I can do at the time of writing. A long way to go and no better time than now. Let the Upward Mobility commence. 

01: Host Discovery

Firstly we attempt to gather more information on the infected host in question.

We can quickly take a look at the endpoint information in the Statistics tab. We check for IPV4 and organize by packets.
